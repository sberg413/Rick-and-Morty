This implementation shows off several best practices, libraries, and concepts. Among these are:
* MVVM Architecture
* Jetpack Compose
* Architecture APIs
* Androidx Paging3
* Room DB
* ViewModel
* Hilt DI
* Flow
* Retrofit
* Glide

A TODO list if more time were to be dedicated to the project is as follows:
* Implement better error handling for bad network and response error scenarios
* Replace hardcoded strings with resource strings
* Improve the UI with an improved color palette.
* Implement dark theme
* Implement additional details with additional click-throughs (episodes, planets, etc.)
